                            Vollut is a digital artist who builds his work around comedy and animation.
                            Born and raised in a small city in Russia he developed his career online and
                            was heavily influenced by digitalization and the global web. Being a part of
                            the generation that uses memes to express themselves he found his voice in
                            similar things. Thatâ€™s why you can see a lot of pop-cultural references in his work.
